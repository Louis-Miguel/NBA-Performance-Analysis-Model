<h3>Background</h3>
Basketball has become a widely embraced global sport with fans spanning various age
groups. This surge in popularity has inspired our statistical examination of basketball teams to
assess their performance. The National Basketball Association (NBA), a professional basketball
league in North America comprising 30 teams (NBA Staff, 2019), remains a significant
contributor to the sport's global appeal, as indicated by Statista Research Department (2021).
Perhaps the most obvious question in basketball analytics is which NBA players go above and
beyond to assist their teams in winning games. Furthermore, it is also desirable to recognize
which specific statistic or attribute has the biggest impact on winning games.


In the larger field of sports analytics, this analysis model attempts to improve our
comprehension of NBA team dynamics and make a positive impact on statistical modeling and
analytical developments. The study aims to provide useful tools for both fans and team owners
by addressing fundamental problems regarding forecasting NBA results.
